# ML_Tissue2CellLine
This contins machine learning based tasks

This repository contains code for performing genomics data analysis. The analysis includes principal component analysis (PCA) and classification using machine learning algorithms.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following packages installed:

- sva
- DESeq2
- caret
- parallelly
- gower
- dplyr
- data.table
- edgeR
- pamr
- pROC

If any package is missing, you can run the `check_and_install_package()` function provided in the code to automatically install and load the required packages.

## Usage

1. Prepare your data: Place your data file named `data.txt` in the repository root directory. The file should be tab-separated with a header row. Adjust the column names and data format if necessary.

2. Prepare your phenotype data: Place your phenotype data file named `batches.txt` in the repository root directory. The file should be tab-separated with a header row. Adjust the column names and data format if necessary.

3. Run the code: Execute the code in an R environment or RStudio. The code will read the data and perform the analysis, including PCA and classification using machine learning algorithms.

4. Interpret the results: The code generates various plots and outputs, such as PCA plots, dot plots, confusion matrices, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. These outputs provide insights into the data analysis results.
